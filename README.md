# Redis URL Shortener

Microservices are at the heart of most modern-day apps. They are popular due to their modular properties and enable apps to scale like never before. My project is a reimagination of a relatively popular 'URL-shortening' app but built and powered with Redis.

This app shortens/modifies URLs which can be used to potentially gather analytics about certain posts or resources the user is sharing online. The final URL length can be modified using parameters on the backend. This is a relatively simple microservice, which can be further modified into a dedicated API with authentication for different use cases
